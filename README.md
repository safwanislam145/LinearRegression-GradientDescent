# Machine Learning Specialization

This project demonstrates the implementation of linear regression using gradient descent. The code includes functions to compute the cost, compute the gradient, and perform gradient descent to find the optimal parameters for the linear regression model.

## Notebooks

### vectorization.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates the concept of vectorization in machine learning. Vectorization is a technique used to speed up the computations by performing operations on entire arrays instead of individual elements.

### lr_cost_gradientdescent.ipynb
This notebook covers the implementation of linear regression using gradient descent. It includes the calculation of the cost function and the gradient descent algorithm to optimize the parameters.

### Restaurant_Profit_Prediction_LR.ipynb
This project aims to predict the profit of a restaurant based on the population of the city it is located in. The prediction is made using a simple linear regression model.
